# iaconelli_build

This is a project that runs snippets of video of Ike Iaconelli
through a Raspberry Pi Pico and out to an aux port, which goes
to speakers whenever a button is pressed. 

Ike is a professional bass fisherman who is well known for
his enthusiasm and excitement he gets when he catches fish,
which usually results in him screaming.
